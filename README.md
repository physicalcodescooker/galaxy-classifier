# Galaxy Morphology Classifier
The goal is to build a convolutional neural network that classifies galaxy morphologies (spiral vs elliptical) using Galaxy Zoo data, achieving a considerable accuracy. The repository is to log the learning and creation process. As a Physics undergraduate with only the basics of ML down, the intricate details are brushed aside to make this project more efficient in terms of time and effort. This project is aimed to fulfil the following:

1.Learn to use real astronomical data from citizen science projects and acquire the essential skill of data analysis. 

2.Demonstrate ML skills to potential research supervisors.

3.Foundation for more complex astrophysics ML projects.

# Galaxy Morphological Classifier
Galaxies fill the universe with mysterious forms and complex shapes. However, as cryptic as the patterns might be on initial observation, increased availability of data and the advanced technologies providing clearer visualizations of galaxies even from millions of lightyears away has made it possible for scientists to form classifications of them. From these groups, different properties of astrophysical importance like the evolution and formation of galaxies can be predicted. Thus, the aim of classification is not only to group together similar looking galaxies but also increase our physical understanding of them.

Morphological classification is a system that groups galaxies based on their physical appearance e.g their form and shape as seen in images captured by telescopes. Galaxies can be characterized based on certain physical properties like the shape of their centres, the shape and existence of their spirals, their ellipticity, etc.  There are several schemes by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the Hubble sequence, devised by Edwin Hubble and expanded by GÃ©rard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now largely done using computational methods. Another developed method today is the highly successfull method of using crowd-sourced visual inspection (i.e. Galaxy Zoo1 ) to provide quantitative visual morphologies.
