# Galaxy Morphology Classifier
The goal is to build a convolutional neural network that classifies galaxy morphologies (spiral vs elliptical) using Galaxy Zoo data, achieving a considerable accuracy. The repository is to log the learning and creation process. As a Physics undergraduate with only the basics of ML down, the intricate details are brushed aside to make this project more efficient in terms of time and effort. This project is aimed to fulfil the following:

1.Learn to use real astronomical data from citizen science projects and acquire the essential skill of data analysis. 

2.Demonstrate ML skills to potential research supervisors.

3.Foundation for more complex astrophysics ML projects.
